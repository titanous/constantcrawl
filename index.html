        <p>Think of ConstantCrawl as a more complete version of the <a href='http://archive.org/'>Internet Archive</a> stored on <a href='https://freenetproject.org/'>Freenet</a> and accessible through your browser. ConstantCrawl keeps a copy of every page you visit. These copies are pushed in a distributed datastore, a few of them on every user&#8217;s computer. The network replicates files confidentially and securely based on demand. Each user contributes a very small amount of disk space and bandwidth to the network similar to how <a href='http://www.csc.kth.se/~gkreitz/spotify-p2p10/spotify-p2p10.pdf'>some music services</a> work today. With enough users this will become a complete cache of the internet, capturing nearly every change to every file on the public web and making them available in real-time.</p>

<h2 id='consequences'>Consequences</h2>

<h3 id='no_downtime'>No downtime</h3>

<p>DDoS attacks and traffic spikes don&#8217;t make sites unavailable. When you try to reach a site that&#8217;s unresponsive, ConstantCrawl finds the most recent cached copy on the network and loads it instead. If a page loaded for anyone it loads for everyone.</p>

<h3 id='no_retractions'>No Retractions</h3>

<p>Once information has been pushed into the network, it&#8217;s accessible to everyone. Now retroactive changes to published works can be easily verified and accounted for.</p>

<h3 id='better_search_engines'>Better Search Engines</h3>

<p>ConstantCrawl&#8217;s network reflects the pages people actually visit, and how often they are visited. The pages in the ConstantCrawl network are enough to create a free and open index of the web. Now it&#8217;s easier for new search engines to compete on product instead of data collection. More competition is better for everyone.</p>

<h3 id='distributed_search'>Distributed Search</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s possible to build a distributed search engine on top of ConstantCrawl. All the data is already in the network. Peers in the network could run search nodes as well.</p>

<h2 id='status'>Status</h2>

<p>ConstantCrawl is currently in development.</p>
